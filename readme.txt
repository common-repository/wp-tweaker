Optimize the performance of your WordPress installation by simply disabling unneeded WordPress-functions. All you have to do is switch them off in the WP Tweaker Panel.

== Description ==
WordPress automatically provides some features that not every blogger really needs. And you shouldn't have to carry around things you don't need. From a performance point of view, it makes absolute sense to completely deactivate unnecessary functions. The loading times of your blog will definitely improve noticeably!

With this WP-Tweaker you can controll the following functions/features of WordPress:

* Remove your WP-Version from the header
* Deactivate the WP-Emojis
* Remove the Windows Live Writer
* Remove the RSD-Link
* Remove the RSS-Links
* Remove the Shortlink
* Remove links to adjacent posts
* Limit the stored Post-Revisions to a maximum of 5
* Disable automatic http-requests by Plugins & Themes
* Disable the WordPress-hearbeat
* Disable login error messages
* Disable new Theme on major WP updates
* Disable the XML-RPC
* Remove post by e-mail function
* Remove the url-field from comments
* Disable url auto-linking in comments
* Disable login-shake for wrong credentials
* Empty the WP-Trash every 7 days
* Remove query strings from ressources
* Disable auto-saving blogs

All you need to do to control this features/functions is
1. Install and activate this Plugin
2. Turn each of the features/functions simply on or off

There are more features for this plugin to come. Most of them are already in the pipeline for production. As of now there are already 12 new functions/feature in my backlog.
